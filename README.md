# Product-Recommendation-System
## Project Overview
This project develops a sophisticated product recommendation system specifically tailored for an e-commerce platform, leveraging the powerful data warehousing capabilities of Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By utilizing a suite of GCP services along with advanced SQL queries in BigQuery, the system efficiently processes large datasets to generate personalized product recommendations aimed at enhancing user experience and boosting sales.

## Key Features and Technologies:
1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Utilizes BigQuery for robust data processing and analysis, allowing for scalable and efficient handling of large volumes of e-commerce data.
2. BigQuery: Serves as the backbone for data storage and querying, enabling complex analytical queries that drive the recommendation logic.
3. Data Studio: Used for visualizing KPIs and the performance metrics of various products, providing intuitive dashboards that help in quick decision-making and reporting.
4. Personalized Recommendations: Implements machine learning models and heuristic algorithms within BigQuery to tailor product suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.
5. Performance Analytics: Integrates a system to categorize products as 'good' or 'bad' based on performance thresholds defined by key performance indicators like click-through rates, purchase rates, and revenue generated.

## Goals:
1. Enhance User Experience: Provide personalized product recommendations to users, leveraging their browsing and purchasing history to tailor suggestions that are likely to result in increased user engagement and satisfaction.
2. Increase Conversion Rates: Strategically recommend products to maximize conversion rates, using data-driven insights to present the most appealing items to each user.
3. Optimize Inventory Management: Recommend products based on real-time availability and historical sales data to manage inventory more effectively, reducing overstock and stockouts.
4. Data-Driven Decision Making: Employ Data Studio visualizations to interpret complex data sets, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on current trends and product performance.

## How It Works:
The recommendation system operates through a detailed process involving multiple stages of data handling and analysis:
i. Data Collection: Continuous ingestion of user activity and sales data into BigQuery, ensuring rich datasets are available for analysis.
ii. Data Processing and Analysis: Using SQL in BigQuery, the data is processed to identify patterns and trends. This includes the segregation of products into 'good' or 'bad' categories based on their performance against set KPIs.
iii. Recommendation Algorithm: Algorithms run within BigQuery to generate personalized product recommendations. These algorithms consider user preferences, product popularity, stock levels, and historical performance.
iv. Visualization and Reporting: Data Studio is used to create dashboards that visually represent the outcomes of recommendations and their effectiveness, offering actionable insights into user behavior and system performance.
v. Feedback Loop: User interactions with the recommended products are tracked and fed back into the system to refine and improve the recommendation algorithms continuously.

By incorporating these technologies and methodologies, the project ensures a robust and scalable solution that not only meets the current e-commerce demands but also adapts to future changes in user behavior and market conditions.
